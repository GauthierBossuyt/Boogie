# Boogie

## **Description**

Boogie enriches the Spotify experience by giving everyone a voice through its voting system, while the audio-reactive visuals enchant the atmosphere and the moderation tool keeps it fun. Boogie is a webapplication made with **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**. The backend is published on another **[repository](https://github.com/GauthierBossuyt/BOOGIE-API)**.
